I don‚Äôt have a specific voting ethos, but I am very open to discussion and others‚Äô ideas. I have been a very active member of this discourse and the discord. My goal is to work with others to turn APW into the next great DEFI primitive like Curve, AAVE, MAKER, etc‚Ä¶',

    bio: 'Belgian DeFi lover since 2020. I have a good experience in the governance from Paladin, Paraswap and more recently I am DeFi / Technical Writer at Mimo. From my experiencen I realized the importance of governance in DeFi, and I can also understand that some people do not have time to be fully interested in it as much as I or the other delegates, This is why I want to take care of your voting power, because like you, I want APWine to be stronger and go further by taking the right decisions. Delegation can be done on my ENS : Starny.eth',
