    bio: 'Belgian DeFi lover since 2020. I have a good experience in the governance from Paladin, Paraswap and more recently I am DeFi / Technical Writer at Mimo. From my experiencen I realized the importance of governance in DeFi, and I can also understand that some people do not have time to be fully interested in it as much as I or the other delegates, This is why I want to take care of your voting power, because like you, I want APWine to be stronger and go further by taking the right decisions. Delegation can be done on my ENS : Starny.eth',
